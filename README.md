# Portfolio Creator

Portfolio Creator is an open source project that aims to allow users to easily create an online portfolio. Users can create sections with a title and a description, and add cards with different projects where they can add images, links, keywords, title, and description. This project was created for educational purposes, and pull requests are welcome.

## Demo

A live version can be seen at https://portfolio-generator-gamma.vercel.app/

## Disclaimer

As this project was educationnal some of the code may not be optimized and especially when it comes to fetching data from supabase. Using a state management libray is on my roadmap for this project.

## Tech Stack

The project uses the following technologies:

Next.js: a popular React framework for building server-side-rendered (SSR) applications.
Typescript: a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that provides improved developer experience and fewer runtime errors.
Tailwind: a CSS utility-first framework that provides a set of pre-defined classes to make styling more efficient.
Supabase: an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a suite of tools for building and scaling web applications.
